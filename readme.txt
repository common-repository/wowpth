WoWPth lets you create your theme and customize its structure in an easy and interactive way. It allows you to define your own layout.

You can customize width and height of the layout using sliders and add and delete partitions of divisions up to a level.
Areas can also be resized in width and height by dragging the handles that separate the boxes; each area is widget enabled.

It is also maintained the possibility to access the version 1.0 of the plugin in case you prefer a more traditional layout.

The generated themes also allow to edit the image header and the background of the theme and support WordPress widgets and custom menus.
